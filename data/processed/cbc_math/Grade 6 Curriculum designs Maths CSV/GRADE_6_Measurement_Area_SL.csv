(6 Lessons)","By the end of the Sub 
Strand, the learner should 
be able to;
a)  Work out area of  
triangles in   square 
centimetres (cm2)  in 
different  situations,
b)  Work out area of 
combined shapes 
involving squares, 
rectangles and triangles 
in cm2  in different  
situations,
c)  Use IT devices for 
learning more on area 
and for enjoyment,
d)  Appreciate the use of 
cm2 in working out 
area in real life"," • Learners in pairs/groups 
or as individuals are 
guided to establish that 
the area of a triangle is 
equal to a half of the area 
of a rectangle or a square 
when the rectangle or the 
square is divided by a 
diagonal.  
• Learners in pairs/groups 
work out the area of 
triangles in cm2 using the 
relationship between a 
rectangle and a triangle 
(Area of a triangle is 
equal to ½ area of a 
rectangle or square. 
A = ½ (Lx W). 
• Learners in pairs/groups 
or as individuals to come 
up with own combined 
shapes involving 
rectangles squares,
 • triangles and ask other 
groups/pairs to determine 
the area.
 • Learners in pairs/groups 
to play digital games 
involving area.","Where is area 
used in real life?"
