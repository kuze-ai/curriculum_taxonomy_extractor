Identify the tonne as 
a unit for measuring 
mass in real life,
b) 
Identify items 
measured in tonnes in 
real life,
c) 
Identify the 
relationship between 
the kilogram and the 
tonne practically, 
d)  Estimate mass in 
tonnes in different 
situations,
e)  Convert kilograms to 
tonnes and tonnes to 
kilograms in real life 
situations,

measuring mass."," • Learners in pairs/
 groups/ or as individuals 
are guided to identify 
the tonne as a unit of 
measuring mass though 
discussions.
 • Learners in pairs/groups/
 or as individuals to 
discuss items whose 
mass may be measured in 
tonnes 
• Leaners in pairs/groups 
or as individuals to 
identify the relationship 
between the kilogram 
and the tonne (1000kg = 
1 tonne).
 • Learners in pairs estimate 
mass of objects in tonnes. 
• Learners in pairs/groups 
or as individuals to 
convert kilograms to tonnes and tonnes to 
kilograms in real life 
situations.
 • Learners in pairs/groups 
or as individuals to 
determine mass of items 
in tonnes and kilograms 
using different operations 
in real life situations. 
• Learners in pairs/groups/
 individuals to play digital 
games involving mass","1.  How can we 
measure large 
amounts of 
mass? 
2. 
 In what 
situations 
would the 
tonne be more 
applicable 
to use when 
measuring 
mass?"
