(14 Lessons)","By the end of the Sub 
Strand, the learner should 
be able to;
a) 
 Use the millimetre 
(mm) as a unit of 
measuring length in 
different situations, 
b)  Establish the 
relationship between 
the millimetre and 
centimetre  in different 
situations, 
c)  Convert  centimetres to 
millimetres in different 
situations,
d)  Convert  millimetres to 
centimetres in different 
situations,
e) 
 add centimetres and 
millimetres in different 
situations,
f) 
Subtract centimetres 
and millimetres in 
different situations,
 g) Multiply centimetres 
and millimetres by 
whole numbers in real 
life situations,
 h) Divide centimetres and 
millimetres by whole 
numbers in real life 
situations,
 i) Measure the 
circumference of a 
circle practically,
 j) Identify the relationship 
between circumference 
and diameter in 
different situations, 
k) Use it devices for 
learning more on length 
and for enjoyment,
 l) Appreciate use of 
length in real life 
situations"," • Learners in pairs/groups
