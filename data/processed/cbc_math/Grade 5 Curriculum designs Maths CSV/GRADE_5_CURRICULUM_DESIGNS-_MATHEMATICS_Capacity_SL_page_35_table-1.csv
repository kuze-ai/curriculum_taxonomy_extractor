,"2.4  Capacity 
       
(12 Lessons)","By the end of the sub strand, the 
learner should be able to; 
a) 
identify the millilitre as a 
unit of measuring capacity 
in real life, 
b)  measure capacity in 
millilitres in real life 
situations, 
c) 
estimate and measure 
capacity in multiples of  5 
millilitres in different 
situations, 
d) 
identify the relationship 
between litres and 
millilitres in real life, 
e) 
convert litres to millilitres 
and millilitres to litres in 
real life situations,
f) 
add litres  and millilitres in 
real life situations, 
g) 
 subtract litres  and in real 
life situations, 
h) 
 multiply  litres  and 
millilitres by whole 
numbers in real life 
situations, 
i) 
divide  litres  and millilitres 
by whole numbers in 
different situations, 
j) 
use IT devices for  learning 
more on capacity and  for 
enjoyment  
k) 
appreciate use of litres and 
millilitres in measuring 
capacity in real life"," 
In pairs,groups or as individuals fill a  
teaspoon or cylinder graduated in 
millilitres   with water and identify that 
the spoon or cylinder  holds 5 millilitres. 
 
In pairs or groups  divide the water in the 
spoon or  cylinder into 5 equal parts and 
identify each part as 1 millilitre. 
 
In  pairs or groups fill small containers 
with water and measure the capacity  in 
millilitres using  a container graduated in 
millilitres. 
 
Learners  watch a video on measuring 
capacity in millilitres.   
 
In  pairs,groups or as individuals estimate 
and measure capacity of different 
containers using a container graduated in 
millilitres.   
 
In  pairs, groups or as individuals  fill a 1- 
litre container using a 100 millilitres 
container. 
 
In  pairs, groups or as individuals count 
the number of 100 millilitre containers 
used to fill the 1- litre container and 
conclude that ten 100- millilitres 
containers fill 1 litre. ( 10x 100 millilitres 
=1000 millilitres = 1 litre) 
 
In  pairs, groups or as individuals to 
convert litres to millilitres and milliliters 
to litres.  
 
In  pairs or groups  work out capacity in 
litres and millilitres using  addition, 
subtraction, multiplication and division. 
 
In  pairs or as individuals  play digital 
games involving capacity.","Where re litres 
and millilitres 
used in day to 
day life?"
