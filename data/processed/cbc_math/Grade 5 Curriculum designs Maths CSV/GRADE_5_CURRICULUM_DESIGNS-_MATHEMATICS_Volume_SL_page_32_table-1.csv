,"2.3 Volume 
      (6 
Lessons)","By the end of the sub 
strand, the learner should 
be able to; 
a) 
identify the cubic 
centimetre (cm3) as a 
unit of measuring 
volume in different 
situations, 
b)  work out volume of 
cubes and cuboids in 
cubic centimetres 
(cm3) in different 
situations, 
c) 
derive the formula for 
the volume  of  cube 
or cuboid as V= l x w 
x h practically,  
d) 
use  the formula V= l 
x w x h  to work out volume of  cubes and 
cuboids  in different 
situations,  
e) 
use IT devices for 
learning more on 
volume  and for 
enjoyment, 
f) 
appreciate use of  
cubic centimetres in 
measuring volume in 
real life."," 
In  pairs, groups or as individuals measure the 
sides of a 1cm cube and identify it as a unit of 
measuring volume.  
 
In  pairs, groups or as individuals arrange a 
number of cubes along the length, width and 
vary the number of layers. 
 
 In  pairs,groups or as individuals count the 
number of cubes used in activity above and 
record.   
 
In  pairs or groups establish that the total number 
of cubes represents the volume of  the cube  or 
cuboid formed. 
 
In  pairs,  groups or as individuals to count the 
number of cubes on the length and multiply by 
the number in the width and the number of 
layers. The learners to establish the formula for 
volume (V) of a cube  or cuboid as V = l x w x 
h.
 
Learners watch a  video on working out volume 
of a cube/cuboid. 
 
In  pairs, groups or as individuals measure the 
dimensions of  a 1cm cube to establish its 
volume as 1cm x 1cm x 1cm = 1cm3 and share 
with other groups.   
 
In  pairs, groups or as individuals work out the 
volume of cubes and cuboids in cubic 
centimetres. 
 
 In  pairs or as individuals  use IT devices to 
play digital games involving volumes.","1.  Where is 
volume
