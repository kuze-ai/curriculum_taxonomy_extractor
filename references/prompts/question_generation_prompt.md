Prompt: If I was to give you the information in the table below like the Strand, Substrand, Specific Learning outcomes, Suggested Learning experiences and key inquiry questions...this is from an education curriculumn framework of Kenya, the grade is _ and the subject is_, would u be able to generate questions and answers from this information? 

Aspects to factor:
- Questions should be multiple choice
- Leverage the learning rubrics and indicator_name to acesses the competecies
