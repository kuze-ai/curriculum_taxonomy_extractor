    "## Steps\n",
    "1. Get answers for question paper\n",
    "  - Take jpeg\n",
    "  - provide pedantic of question_paper(\"number_or_position\",\"instruction\",\"question\", \"number_of_points\")\n",
    "  - Use GPT to get the answer of the question and save it in the json file/object\n",
    "2. Get answers for question:\n",
    "  - Provide GPT-V with the json_object of the questions in pager with the answer\n",
    "  - Ask the GPT to evaluate whether it is correct or not. Get the results from it\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Issues:\n",
    "1. Potentailly cutting when having multiple questions in a page. \n",
    "2. For matching, if a learner scribles, i.e. draw multiple lines, it will show as correct ie. lines were drawn\n",
    "3. Having multiple nested models increases the lenght of time with GPT, thereby increasing cost...\n",
